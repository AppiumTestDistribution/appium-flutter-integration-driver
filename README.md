## Differences from Appium Flutter Driver

The current Appium Flutter Driver is built on top of the `flutter_test` SDK, which is deprecated. The potential deprecation ([Expand deprecation policy to package:flutter_driver](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/139249)) means this driver may not work with future Flutter updates. It also does not handle all cases, such as permission dialog handling.

## Why Use Appium Flutter Integration Driver?

This driver is built using [Flutter Integration Test](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction).

:star: **Strong Typing & Fluent APIs:** Ensures robust and easy-to-use interfaces.

:star: **Element Handling**: Automatically waits for elements to attach to the DOM before interacting.

:star: **Seamless Context Switching**: No need to switch between contexts, such as Flutter and native; the driver handles it effortlessly.

:star: **Auto Wait for Render Cycles**: Automatically waits for frame render cycles, including animations and screen transitions.

:star: **Simplified Powerful Gestures**: Supports powerful yet simplified gestures like LongPress, ScrollToElement, DragAndDrop, and DoubleClick.

:star: **Element Chaining**: Allows chaining of elements, enabling you to find child elements under a specific parent easily.


## Install the Flutter Integration Driver

```bash
appium driver install --source npm appium-flutter-integration-driver
```
## Prepare the app with Flutter Integration Server

1. In your Flutter app's `pubspec.yaml`, add the following dependencies:

Get the latest version from `https://pub.dev/packages/appium_flutter_server/install`

   ```yaml
   dev_dependencies:
     appium_flutter_server: 0.0.16
   ```

2. Create a directory called `integration_test` in the root of your Flutter project.
3. Create a file called `appium_test.dart` in the `integration_test` directory.
4. Add the following code to the `appium_test.dart` file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:appium_flutter_server/appium_flutter_server.dart';
   import 'package:appium_testing_app/main.dart';

   void main() {
     initializeTest(app: const MyApp());
   }
   ```
   If you are in need to configure certain prerequists before the testing app is loaded, you can try the following code:
   ```dart
   import 'package:appium_testing_app/main.dart'; as app;
   void main() {
     initializeTest(
       callback: (WidgetTester tester) async {
          // Perform any prerequisite steps or intialise any dependencies required by the app
          // and make sure to pump the app widget using below statement.
          await tester.pumpWidget(const app.MyApp());
       },
     );
   }
   ```

5. Build the Android app:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew app:assembleDebug -Ptarget=`pwd`/../integration_test/appium.dart
   ```

6. Build the iOS app:
    For Simulator - Debug mode
    ```bash
      flutter build ios integration_test/appium.dart --simulator
    ```
    For Real Device - Release mode
    ```bash
      flutter build ipa --release integration_test/appium.dart
    ```

Bingo! You are ready to run your tests using Appium Flutter Integration Driver.

Check if your Flutter app is running on the device or emulator.

For Android
```
1. Run adb command `adb logcat | grep flutter` to check if the Flutter app is running.
2. Open the application in the device or emulator manually.
3. Verify the logs in the console.
```

## Appium Flutter Integration Driver vs. Appium UiAutomator2/XCUITest Driver

- The driver manages the application under test and the device under test via Appium UiAutomator2/XCUITest drivers.
- Newer Flutter versions expose their accessibility labels to the system's accessibility features. This means some Flutter elements can be found and interacted with using `accessibility_id` in the vanilla Appium UiAutomator2/XCUITest drivers, although some elements require interaction over the Dart VM.
- Using native driver command will directly hit the Appium UiAutomator2/XCUITest driver.

For more details, refer to the documentation for each driver:

- [Appium UiAutomator2 Driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver)
- [Appium XCUITest Driver](https://appium.github.io/appium-xcuitest-driver/latest)

## How to Inspect elements?
- You can use the flutter inspector tool to inspect the elements in your Flutter app. You can find the tool [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/inspector)
